- [ ] make the reactions A LOT more efficient by calculating the counts in sql rather than js
- [ ] index pages (and coments): every post should have a square thumbnail, which is either main extracted image, or
      screenshot of site
- [ ] detail pages: show big square and thumbnail squares underneath for all attachments.
- [ ] maybe we need an /about page or main directory that links you to all the bots with curated feeds, like best_of,
      tag rankings, user rankings, etc? no obvious way to see which communities are available. maybe just link to a
      "start here" post?
  - [ ] in the header, link to an official @ding post with places to start, etc
- [ ] we need a site/url/host tag like ~taylor.town or /taylor.town
- [ ] if you hit "reply" and you're not logged in it should prompt to create new account
- [ ] figure out adding/managing private tags. /t for creating private tag? /t for editing/moderating the tag and adding
      users?
- [ ] show better titles for search pages, e.g. "#foo" if just searching the foo tag. add actions like "add to
      homepage". "*foo" should also show special info
- [ ] the searchbar should always show the full query, including "baz +#foo -#bar"
- [ ] create a "bestof" bot that collects and summarizes stuff from around the site. they're just normal posts like any
      other. don't define any special rec engines or discovery in the database.
- [ ] preview link/image on hover
- [ ] add related tags and posts to footer (backlinks)
- [ ] add mod/flagging mechanism by commenting "spam" or "abuse"
- [ ] prettier signin/signup/forgot-password ui. probably form and links on /u
- [ ] bubbletea cli/tui
- [ ] launch
- [ ] bare links should open external site in new tab
- [ ] find specific discord/slack/reddit/zulip/discourse communities (esp. mods) that want to try ding out
- [ ] publish guides on how to move community archives over and/or livesync from discord/slack/etc
- [ ] add shortcuts for post/reply types: start huddle/room/livestream, upload file, record audio/video, draw picture,
      remix
