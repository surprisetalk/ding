- [ ] make the reactions A LOT more efficient by calculating the counts in sql rather than js
- [ ] maybe we need an /about page or main directory that links you to all the bots with curated feeds, like best_of,
      tag rankings, user rankings, etc? no obvious way to see which communities are available. maybe just link to a
      "start here" post?
- [ ] users should be able to define favorite tags or favorite searches, which show up on home page, or are home page?
      or maybe just convention to add favorite tags and search links to personal profile? also disliked tags?
- [ ] hook up a bunch of fun bots and rss feed reposters
- [ ] sort comments by new or top
- [ ] change from /c to /p?
- [ ] if you hit "reply" and you're not logged in it should prompt to create new account
- [ ] header: /, ... /about, /c? (search/explore), /u (settings/login)
- [ ] /t for creating private tag? /t for editing/moderating the tag and adding users?
- [ ] edit default homepage tags on profile page
- [ ] show better titles for search pages, e.g. "#foo" if just searching the foo tag. add actions like "add to
      homepage". "*foo" should also show special info
- [ ] add @user as a tag name for dms and group chats
- [ ] the searchbar should always show the full query, including "baz +#foo -#bar"
- [ ] create a "bestof" bot that collects and summarizes stuff from around the site. they're just normal posts like any
      other. don't define any special rec engines or discovery in the database.
- [ ] preview link/image on hover
- [ ] add related tags and posts to footer (backlinks)
- [ ] add mod/flagging mechanism by commenting "spam" or "abuse"
- [ ] bubbletea cli/tui
- [ ] launch
- [ ] bare links should open external site in new tab
- [ ] find specific discord/slack/reddit/zulip/discourse communities (esp. mods) that want to try ding out
- [ ] publish guides on how to move community archives over and/or livesync from discord/slack/etc
- [ ] add shortcuts for post/reply types: start huddle/room/livestream, upload file, record audio/video, draw picture,
      remix
